Parable Pi is a Raspberry Pi implementation of Parable. The program is used for the sequencing of flame effects.

This version introduces two significant changes: it directs output to the GPIO ports on the Raspberry Pi (rather than
sending output to a legacy parallel port) and it responds to keypresses to trigger sequences, so I doesn't require a
mouse for operation.
